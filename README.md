# Fraud Detection System 💳🔍

This project implements a **Fraud Detection System** using machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on historical data patterns.

The goal is to assist financial institutions in **detecting suspicious activities early** and reducing financial losses caused by fraud.

## 📌 Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions are rare but highly impactful. Traditional rule-based systems fail to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.  
This project uses **data-driven machine learning models** to classify transactions as **Fraudulent** or **Legitimate** based on input features.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Feature selection and scaling
- Supervised machine learning classification
- Model evaluation using performance metrics

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load transaction dataset

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Encoding categorical variables (if present)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Fraud vs non-fraud distribution
   - Feature correlation analysis

4. **Model Training**
   - Train classification model(s) on transaction data

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix

6. **Prediction**
   - Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate
